Someday:

- FIX: undeploy leaves jena.jar in WEB-INF/lib
       DevTime workaround not working.

- FIX: (when trying from any separate browser while gwt-shell is running):
       When selecting a SPV URI starts extra new window.
       Kill that window and the original window with the Request/Response
       done.

- More Jena.

- Figure out how to make spv panels expand.

- Style
